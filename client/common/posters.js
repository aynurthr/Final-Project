      "The premiere took place on April 15, 2021.<br/><br/>Based on the film scripts 'Ivan's Childhood' and 'Mirror'.<br/><br/>Ivan is a child consumed by adult passions. He lost his childhood to war and died because he lived like an adult. The story is built around the character of the boy, but there are episodes that reveal his childish traits. A precise detail is found in the story — playing at war — what could be scarier! Everything here is very deep, terrifying, and truthful, leaving no room for adventurous romance...<br/><br/>Ivan dreams of the life he is deprived of, an ordinary childhood. In his dreams, there is a normal happy childhood. In real life — that terrible absurdity occurs when a child is forced to fight.",
